uhm
1. put your data in
2. change your config
3. change the voltage list
4. run

itll output two graphs, one thats a lagrangian interpolatin of your data basically graphically predicting the other voltages
the other is a laplace equation that runs iterations for your voltages based on your data to create what ideal equipotential lines look like
